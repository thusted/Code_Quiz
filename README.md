# Homework_04
This assignment required students to create a timed quiz with Javascript fundamental questions. When the start button is clicked, a timer begins and the user is presented with their first question. When the question is answered, the user is presented with another question. If the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the timer. When the timer reaches 0 or if all questions are answered, the quiz is over and the user is given a score. They then have the option to store their score with their initials and repeat the quiz.
